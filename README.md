# Face Recognition System

## Overview

The Face Recognition System is a comprehensive project designed to authenticate individuals based on their facial features. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system offers a reliable and efficient solution for identity verification in various applications such as security access control, attendance tracking, and personalized user experiences.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizes deep learning algorithms to extract unique facial features from input images or video frames.
- **CSV Database:** Stores facial data and associated metadata in a structured CSV format, facilitating efficient storage, retrieval, and management of facial data.
- **Workflow:** Encompasses enrollment, authentication, and verification processes for seamless identity verification.

## Usage

1. **Face Registration:** Add individuals to the database by providing real time facial data.
2. **Face Verification:** Compare the captured face_data against database entries to authenticate individuals.
